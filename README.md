## FOURSQUARE TEST

The test starts by taking the user to the home page where. In the home page three cities can be found Londom, Manchester and Newcastle. The idea behind it is very simple.
Select a City where you'd like to search for venues.

After type in the search bar the keywords you wish, and you should find the info you're looking for.

For this test I decided to only display 30 results, each containing a title and URL. If a result doesn't include an URL then this is removed, only showing the title.
